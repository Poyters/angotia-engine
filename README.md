## Technology behind the Angotia Engine
### Database
- **PostgreSQL** - The choice of SQL database was brilliant. The game stores a lot of data that is consistent and predictable. In this case, PostgreSQL benefit from the *ACID* model and *distributed transactions*.

### Backend 
- **Nestjs** - Provides OOP architecture and built it solutions for common cases like Authentication, data injection, pipelines and so on.
- **Fastify** - Used to speed up Nestjs framework
- **TypeORM** - Set up tools to work with SQL database. Without it, I would need to write them by hand.
- **TypeScript** - I need to keep the data and types consistent.

### Authentication
- **Keycloak** - I chose it because of the many customisation options and the ability to self-host so as not to be tied to one service provider.

### Others
- **Angotia SDK** - It is a Software Development Kit created from scratch that provides common functions between Angotia microservices, such as contract, interfaces, tools and so on. I create it to do not copy same utils and data between microservices, and to have a singile source of truth in terms of contract, interfaces.
- **Grafana&Prometheus** - I chose it because it's free and open source solution for monitoring and the ability to self-host so as not to be tied to one service provider.
